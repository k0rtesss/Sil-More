D:amid ruin their wisdom blossoms quietly, awaiting renewal and peace 
D:beyond sorrowful days when forests burn and stars alone remember.

#Vanyar

#High Elves, golden-haired and purest-hearted beneath Valinor's radiance,
#loyal companions of Valar, singers whose voices echo joy eternal. 
#Dwelling forever in light beyond grief, untouched by shadow's stain, 
#watching sorrowful fate of kin afar across seas of exile and loss. 
#Their distant wisdom foreshadows future healing when darkness fades; 
#their songs in timeless peace await Eldar’s return from sorrow's depths, 
#unblemished yet sorrowful, bound to grief by kinship and love. 

#Teleri

#Elves of the sea, silver-haired mariners whose ships glide white waves, 
#whose voices blend sorrow with beauty, forever grieving ships burned. 
#Bound by longing for sea and stars, dwelling at shores distant from war, 
#their hearts wounded by kin-slaying, memory darkening gentle songs. 
#Foreshadowing future partings upon endless tides, grief and farewell, 
#yet hope endures in ocean depths, whispering healing yet unseen, 
#awaiting peace beyond sorrow, sea winds carrying away tears forever.

#Maiar

#Spirits divine yet humble, dwelling unseen amid winds, flame, and sea; 
#messengers and servants of Valar, shaping destiny behind veiled form. 
#Their wisdom subtly guides paths of Elf and mortal toward hidden hope, 
#yet their kindred spirits darken, foreshadowing fell deeds yet done. 
#Bound by duty eternal, watching Arda's unfolding grief and triumph, 
#whispering courage into hearts, preparing unseen future glory and ruin, 
#shaping fate quietly until final judgment, when veils fall away.
