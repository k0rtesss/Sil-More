# Sections
# - Styles: N:/G:/W:/Y:/F:/D: define tile coordinates per style.
#   - W: wall tile (row:col)
#   - Y: vein tile (row:col). If omitted, a default overlay is used (see E: below).
#   - F: floor tile(s) (row:col). May include multiple space-separated tokens;
#        one variant is chosen per level (and per vault) and used consistently.
#   - D: door tile(s) (row:col). May include multiple space-separated tokens;
#        one variant is chosen per level (and per vault) and used consistently.
# - Defaults:
#   - E:row:col sets the default vein overlay tile used whenever a style omits Y:.
#     In that case, the vein is drawn as a transparent overlay over the wall.
#     If Y: is present for a style, the vein fully replaces the wall tile.
#   - EK:R:G:B (optional) sets an explicit color-key for overlays (Windows renderer).
#     If not set, the overlay's own top-left pixel color is used as the key.
#     Use EK if your overlay's transparent color is not the top-left pixel.
# Notes
# - Level/vault rules (L:/U:) are in style-levels.txt now.
# - Lighting/darker variants use col+1 when applicable.

# Default vein overlay tile (used when a style omits Y:)

M:You take your first steps into the mountain's throat, upon stones the colour of ash and regret. The memory of the sun is already a treasure you have lost.
M:These are the outer courts of Angband, hewn with a brutal purpose in the Elder Days. The very air is a fine dust, ground from the bones of hopeless mountains.
M:A chill seeps from the seamless grey blocks, the same that lingers in the pass of the Helcaraxë. You are in the North now, and the Valar's light feels a world away.

M:The way shifts to a floor of starkly checkered stone, a cold and loveless pattern. You are a piece in a game of sentient, a move upon a board laid by a masterful, evil mind.
M:A calculated order governs these halls, a design as sharp and unforgiving as a tyrant's law. This is the thought of Sauron given form, a place where all freedom is an illusion.
M:You tread a path where every step feels foreseen, each tile a square in an inescapable trap. The malice here is not of rage, but of a chilling and absolute intellectual pride.

M:The stone refines to a cool and subtle blue, veined like a winter sky. It is the stolen craft of the Dwarves of Nogrod, its beauty enslaved to adorn this pit of dread.
M:A profound stillness fills these sculpted halls; the air is heavy with the silence that followed the fall of Nargothrond. You feel you walk through a beautiful, elaborate tomb.
M:Though finely wrought, a deep cold emanates from the polished walls. It is the cold of a heart that once knew light and now hates it with a perfect and undying memory.

M:The perfection of the stonework here is a cage for the spirit, its flawless lines a testament to dominion. This deep place was not built in haste, but with the dark patience of an immortal evil.
M:Your hope wavers before this unadorned yet flawless craft. It is the cold logic of the abyss given form, where all paths lead only to the Master's unblinking will.
M:The endless, repeating patterns mock the fleeting lives of Men and the fading of the Elves. Here, you are a brief flicker in a design that is eternal and unchanging.

M:The passage narrows, walled by massive, cyclopean blocks of darkened stone. It feels as though you are walking down the throat of the Ered Engrin, the Iron Mountains themselves.
M:These are the deep foundations of the fortress, laid when the world was young. A slumbering, ancient power resides in the oppressive weight of the rock.
M:The air grows thin and heavy, smelling of crushed adamant and the outer void. This is the bedrock of woe, where the groaning of the world is a constant, unheard whisper.

M:You enter a passage of large, sickly green stones that weep a foul, glistening slime. It is a perversion of the green vitality of Yavanna, a life born of decay.
M:The walls pulse with a faint, internal light, as if the very rock is diseased with evil thought. This is the deep corruption of the Shadow, seeping even into the bones of Arda.
M:Your hand recoils from the slick, strangely warm stone; it is the warmth of the grave. You feel the fever of a land blighted by the passing of Glaurung the Deceiver.

M:Dark green growth clings to the joints of the stonework, thriving in the utter darkness. It is an unnatural life, nurtured by sorrow as the grass grew green upon the Haudh-en-Ndengin.
M:The air is thick with the scent of wet rot and things that fester in shadow. It is the reek of the accursed forest of Taur-nu-Fuin brought under the earth.
M:You pass through halls where the walls are furred with a dark, velvety growth. This is the colour of venom, a creeping blight born of dragon-fire and the sorcery of the pit.

M:A brighter, more virulent growth covers these damp walls, glowing with a feverish light. It is a garish mockery of the green hills of Ossiriand, a memory of life twisted into horror.
M:Poisonous water drips slowly, each drop echoing like a tolling bell for the damned. The water itself seems tainted, nourishing only this rampant, unnatural growth.
M:You feel a strange vitality here, but it is the vitality of the swamp and the fen. It is a place of creeping, clinging things that thrive on the ruin of all that is fair.

M:The passage opens into a hall of polished green stone, carved with unsettling, serpentine patterns. This is no natural rock, but a substance born of alchemy and a dragon's thought.
M:A faint, harmonious hum vibrates through the jade-like walls, a music that gnaws at your resolve. It is a song of enthrallment, a lure for the lost children of Húrin.
M:The elegance of the chamber is a lie, its beauty as cold and sharp as a shard of glass. It is the calculated perfection of the Serpent's gaze, mesmerizing and utterly deadly.

M:You delve into a passage of crude, black stone that seems to drink the very light from your soul. This is the colour of the Void, the Unlight that came with Ungoliant to slay the Two Trees.
M:The walls are rough and jagged, tearing at your cloak as a foretaste of the malice to come. It is a place of pure hate, unadorned by any craft save that of ruin itself.
M:An oppressive silence reigns in these black-walled corridors. It is the silence that follows a final scream, a place where all hope has been devoured by the dark.

M:The very masonry is built of the faces of the dead, their silent screams frozen in the stone. You have come to a place where valour and despair are the mortar that binds the walls.
M:You walk now through a catacomb of sorrow, where the slain of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad form the foundation. A curse lies on this place, the weight of Tears Unnumbered.
M:The air is cold with the breath of the unhoused fëar, their last cries trapped within the rock. You feel the gaze of a thousand skulls that have no eyes.

M:You stand in a chamber of mottled purple and green, the colours of a deep and poisoned wound. The very air shimmers with a malevolent, sorcerous energy, the craft of the Necromancer.
M:The stone is neither living nor dead, but trapped in a state of foul enchantment. The patterns swirl like oil on black water, mesmerizing and corrupting the senses.
M:A low, discordant hum emanates from the walls, a vibration felt in your teeth and bones. It is the sound of mighty spells being woven, shaping the very fabric of this dungeon.

M:The walls shift to a deep, shimmering blue and violet, lit by a cold, internal fire. It is like gazing into the heart of a poisoned star, a light without warmth or pity.
M:This is the colour of high magic, the strange and terrible light that lingered in the webs of Ungoliant. You feel your own spirit being drawn into its beautiful, damning depths.
M:The beauty of this place is a terrible glamour, a lie laid upon utter despair. It is as fair and as deadly as a Silmaril seen through the eyes of one utterly enthralled.
