# Critical Quest System Fixes Applied

## üîß **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Metarun Quest Completion Detection** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Issue**: `metarun_check_and_update_quests()` not being called or failing silently
**Changes Made**:
- Added detailed debugging to trace function entry and early returns
- Enhanced logging to show `current_run` and `metarun_max` values
- Added debugging around the function call in `update_stuff()`

**Files Modified**: 
- `src/metarun.c`: Enhanced debugging for quest completion detection
- `src/xtra1.c`: Added debugging around metarun function call

### 2. **Quest State Management Fixes** ‚úÖ
**Changes Applied**:
- Added `MANDOS_QUEST_REWARDED` state to prevent repeated reward interactions
- Fixed Aule quest to check base smithing skill instead of total skill
- Updated metarun detection to recognize both SUCCESS and REWARDED states

**Files Modified**:
- `src/defines.h`: Added `MANDOS_QUEST_REWARDED 4`
- `src/xtra2.c`: Fixed Mandos quest state transitions
- `src/generate.c`: Fixed Aule skill check from `skill_use` to `skill_base`
- `src/metarun.c`: Updated quest completion detection for all states

### 3. **Enhanced Quest Vault Debugging** üîç
**Changes Applied**:
- Added comprehensive vault content analysis in `process_quest_vault_area()`
- Logs vault dimensions, tile counts, monster/feature locations
- Enhanced vault placement success/failure logging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/generate.c`: Enhanced debugging in quest vault processing

## üß™ **What to Test**

### Test 1: Metarun Quest Completion Persistence
**Expected**: After compiling, when you complete a quest and start a new character, you should see:
```
TRACE xtra1.c: update_stuff: About to call metarun_check_and_update_quests()
TRACE metarun.c: Metarun quest check: Entry - current_run=X, metarun_max=Y
TRACE metarun.c: Metarun quest check: current_run=X, tulkas=N, aule=N, mandos=N
```

If you see "Early return" instead, then `current_run` is invalid and needs investigation.

### Test 2: Quest Vault Visibility
**Expected**: When a quest vault spawns, you should see:
```
TRACE generate.c: Quest vault processing: Area (Y1,X1) to (Y2,X2), size WxH
TRACE generate.c: Quest vault contents: N walls, N floors, N features, N monsters
```

If you don't see this, the `process_quest_vault_area()` function isn't being called.

### Test 3: Quest Completion State Transitions
**Expected**: When completing Mandos quest, the state should go:
```
SUCCESS(3) ‚Üí give reward ‚Üí REWARDED(4)
```
And metarun should be marked as completed.

## üéØ **Expected Outcomes**

1. **Quest completion will persist across character runs**
2. **Enhanced debugging will reveal why metarun detection fails**
3. **Quest vault content will be visible in logs**
4. **Aule quest will require actual 10+ base smithing skill**

## üìã **Next Steps**

1. **Compile and test** - The latest build should include all fixes
2. **Check log for metarun debugging** - Look for the new trace messages
3. **Test quest completion** - Complete a quest and verify metarun marking
4. **Test new character creation** - Verify completed quests don't respawn

The most critical issue is the metarun quest completion detection. Once that's working, quest persistence should be resolved.
