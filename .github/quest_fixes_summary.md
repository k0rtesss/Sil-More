- [x] Step 4: Update metarun quest completion detection for all quest states
- [x] Step 5: Add proper state handling for completed quests
- [x] Step 6: Compile and validate changes
```

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Mandos Quest Completion Persistence** âœ… 
**Problem**: Quest completion not persisting across character runs
- **Root Cause**: Quest stayed in `MANDOS_QUEST_SUCCESS` state and kept trying to give rewards repeatedly
- **Solution**: Added `MANDOS_QUEST_REWARDED` state (value 4) that prevents repeated reward interactions
- **Changes**:
  - Added `#define MANDOS_QUEST_REWARDED 4` in `defines.h`
  - Modified quest interaction to change state to `MANDOS_QUEST_REWARDED` after giving reward
  - Updated metarun detection to check for both `SUCCESS` and `REWARDED` states
  - Added handler for `MANDOS_QUEST_REWARDED` state in interaction function

### 2. **Aule Quest Smithing Skill Check** âœ…
**Problem**: Aule quest checked total smithing skill instead of base skill  
- **Root Cause**: Used `p_ptr->skill_use[S_SMT]` (total skill with bonuses) instead of `p_ptr->skill_base[S_SMT]` (base skill)
- **Solution**: Changed quest vault spawning check to use base skill only
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `generate.c` line 3684: `skill_use[S_SMT]` â†’ `skill_base[S_SMT]`
  - Updated logging to show "base smithing" for clarity

### 3. **Quest State Management Consistency** âœ…
**Problem**: Inconsistent handling of quest completion states
- **Solution**: Unified all quest completion detection in metarun system
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `metarun_check_and_update_quests()` to check both `SUCCESS` and `REWARDED` states for Aule and Mandos quests
  - Added comprehensive state validation in quest interaction functions
  - Enhanced logging for quest state transitions

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/defines.h`**: Added `MANDOS_QUEST_REWARDED 4` 
2. **`src/xtra2.c`**: 
   - Modified `mandos_quest_interaction()` to set `MANDOS_QUEST_REWARDED` after giving reward
   - Added handler for `MANDOS_QUEST_REWARDED` state
   - Updated safety checks to include new state
3. **`src/metarun.c`**: 
   - Updated quest completion detection for both Aule and Mandos quests
   - Enhanced logging for quest state tracking
4. **`src/generate.c`**: 
   - Changed Aule quest requirement from `skill_use` to `skill_base`

### Logic Flow Fix:
**Before**: Quest SUCCESS â†’ Give Reward â†’ Stay in SUCCESS â†’ Give Reward Again (loop)
**After**: Quest SUCCESS â†’ Give Reward â†’ Set REWARDED â†’ Acknowledge Only

## Expected Results

1. **Mandos Quest Persistence**: 
   - Quest completion will be marked in metarun once and persist across runs
   - No repeated reward interactions
   - Completed quests won't spawn in future runs

2. **Aule Quest Requirements**:
   - Quest will spawn based on base smithing skill only (no equipment bonuses)
   - More predictable quest availability

3. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Detailed logging shows quest state transitions
   - Metarun completion tracking visible in logs
   - Quest vault content validation after placement

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Mandos Quest**:
   - Complete Mandos quest and receive special ability
   - Save game and start new character
   - Verify quest doesn't spawn again (should see "quest completed in metarun" log)

2. **Test Aule Quest**:
   - Test with character having base smithing < 10 but total smithing > 10 (with equipment)
   - Verify quest doesn't spawn (should see "base smithing X < 10" log)

3. **Test Quest State Logging**:
   - Check logs for "Metarun quest check" entries
   - Verify quest completion is detected and marked properly
